        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>"Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games.
          The game's development started in 2014 and was teased under the codename Project A in October 2019. 
          A closed beta period began with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by a release on June 2, 2020. 
          It was originally designed for Windows only, but support for the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 was added 
          in June 2024, albeit without crossplay between PC and console clients. Valorant takes inspiration from the 
          Counter-Strike series, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while 
          moving. Valorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the near future.Players play as 
          one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game 
          mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. 
          Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires 
          charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives."
